### Problem: Task Scheduling for Data Pipelines in MLOps

#### Problem Statement
In an MLOps environment, managing and optimizing the data pipeline for machine learning models is crucial. You are given a list of data processing tasks, each of which has a dependency on one or more other tasks. Your objective is to determine a valid sequence in which these tasks can be executed.

#### Description
- Each task can be represented as a unique integer.
- You will be given a list of pairs `prerequisites`, where `prerequisites[i] = [a, b]` indicates that task `b` must be completed before task `a` can begin.
- Return a valid ordering of tasks in which all tasks can be completed. If no such ordering exists, return an empty array.

#### Function Signature
```python
def findTaskOrder(numTasks: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
```

#### Input
- `numTasks`: An integer representing the total number of tasks.
- `prerequisites`: A list of task pairs, where each pair `[a, b]` indicates that task `b` must be completed before task `a` can start.

#### Output
- Return a list of integers representing the valid order in which the tasks can be executed.
- If no valid order exists, return an empty list.

#### Example

**Example 1:**
```
Input: numTasks = 4, prerequisites = [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
Output: [0,1,2,3] or [0,2,1,3]
Explanation: There are a total of 4 tasks. To complete task 3, tasks 1 and 2 must be completed first. Either [0,1,2,3] or [0,2,1,3] is a valid ordering.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: numTasks = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: []
Explanation: There is no way to complete all tasks.
```

#### Constraints
- `1 <= numTasks <= 10^5`
- `0 <= prerequisites.length <= min(10^5, numTasks * (numTasks - 1) / 2)`
- `prerequisites[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= ai, bi < numTasks`
- All the pairs `prerequisites[i]` are unique.



#### Test case
Sure, here are five test cases that cover various scenarios for the task scheduling problem:

### Test Case 1: Simple Linear Dependency

- **Input**: `numTasks = 3, prerequisites = [[1, 0], [2, 1]]`
- **Expected Output**: `[0, 1, 2]`
- **Explanation**: Task 1 depends on Task 0, and Task 2 depends on Task 1. The tasks can be completed in a straight line.

### Test Case 2: Multiple Dependencies

- **Input**: `numTasks = 4, prerequisites = [[1, 0], [2, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2]]`
- **Expected Output**: `[0, 1, 2, 3]` or `[0, 2, 1, 3]`
- **Explanation**: Task 1 and Task 2 depend on Task 0, and Task 3 depends on both Task 1 and Task 2. There are two valid sequences.

### Test Case 3: No Dependencies

- **Input**: `numTasks = 3, prerequisites = []`
- **Expected Output**: `[0, 1, 2]` or any permutation of `[0, 1, 2]`
- **Explanation**: There are no dependencies, so tasks can be completed in any order.

### Test Case 4: Cycle in Dependencies

- **Input**: `numTasks = 3, prerequisites = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 0]]`
- **Expected Output**: `[]`
- **Explanation**: There's a cycle (0 → 1 → 2 → 0), so there's no valid way to complete all tasks.

### Test Case 5: Complex Dependencies

- **Input**: `numTasks = 6, prerequisites = [[1, 0], [2, 1], [3, 2], [4, 1], [5, 3], [5, 4]]`
- **Expected Output**: `[0, 1, 2, 4, 3, 5]` or `[0, 1, 4, 2, 3, 5]`
- **Explanation**: The tasks have a complex set of dependencies, but there are multiple valid sequences to complete them.

These test cases include various scenarios such as simple linear dependencies, multiple dependencies, no dependencies, a cycle in dependencies, and complex dependencies to thoroughly test the algorithm.
